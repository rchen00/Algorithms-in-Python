"""
Project (Week 7)

You may select only one of following two projects:

P1:
Experiment with the efficiency of the find() method of Pythonâ€™s str class and develop a hypothesis about which pattern-matching algorithm it uses. Try using inputs that are likely to cause both best-case and worst-case running times for various algorithms. Describe your experiments and your conclusions.

P2:
There are eight small islands in a lake, and the state wants to build bridges to connect them so that each island can be reached from any other islands via one or more bridges. Assume the cost of constructing a bridge is proportional to its length. The distances between pairs of islands are in the following table.
	 		2	3	4	5	6	7	8
 		1	240	210	340	280	200	345	120
		2		265	175	215	180	185	155
		3			260	115	350	435	195
		4				160	330	295	230
		5					360	400	170
		6						175	205
		7							305	
a.	Find which bridges to build to minimize the total construction cost.
b.	What if the state wants each island should be reached from any other islands via no more than two bridges? Is there a known algorithm to solve this problem? What would you do?  			

Submit your code together with the run results and your conclusions/solutions.
